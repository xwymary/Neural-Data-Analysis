# Neural-Data-Analysis

### exercise1: spike detection, feature extraction <br />
Tasks: Filter Signal, Detect action potentials, Extract waveforms, Extract features using PCA. <br/>
### exercise2: spike sorting <br />
Tasks: Generate toy data, Implement a Gaussian mixture model, Determine optimum cluster number with BIC score, Spike sorting using Mixture of Gaussian. <br/>
### exercise3: identifying single neurons with cross-correlograms and LDA <br />
Tasks: Visual inspection of clusters and waveforms, Calculate the auto/cross-correlograms of all clusters/pairs of clusters, Implement linear discriminant analysis for cluster separation. <br />
### exercise4: spike inference from calcium data <br />
Tasks: Visualization of calcium and spike recordings, calcium events happen in relationship to the spikes, so we can try simple deconvolution or implement existing algorithms for inferring spikes from calcium traces. Algorithms are evaluated by computing the correlation coefficient between true and inferred spike trains. <br />
### exercise5: visualizing and analyzing spike trains <br />
Tasks: Plot spike rasters, Plot spike density functions, Fit and plot tuning functions, Do permutation test for direction tuning. <br />
### exercise6: estimating information from spike trains <br />
Tasks: Implement entropy estimators (maximum likelihood estimator, miller-maddow corrected estimator, jack-knife corrected estimator, coverage adjusted estimator). Evaluate estimators by Sampling from Uniform distribution and Zipf distribution. <br />
### exercise7: single cell receptive field estimation <br />
Tasks: Fit RF on simulated data, Fit RF on real data with time lags of 0 to 4 frame, Separate space/time components, Regularized receptive field with lasso penalty. <br />
### exercise8: analyzing neural populations <br />
Tasks: Generate some toy data to test the poisson-GPFA code, Plot the ground truth vs. inferred model, Fit Poisson GPFA models to real data and perform model comparison, Visualizing population rasters and latent state (Use the model with a single latent state), Visualization of covariance matrix (One vs five latent state). <br />
### exercise9: RNA transcriptomics <br />
Tasks: Data inspection (Mean-variance relationship, Fano factor, sequencing depths), Low dimensional visualization(PCA, tSNE with and without log or sqrt transformations). <br />
