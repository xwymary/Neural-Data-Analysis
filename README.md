# Neural-Data-Analysis

### exercise1: spike detection, feature extraction <br />
Tasks: Filter Signal, Detect action potentials, Extract waveforms, Extract features using PCA <br/>
### exercise2: spike sorting <br />
Tasks: Generate toy data, Implement a Gaussian mixture model, Determine optimum cluster number with BIC score, Spike sorting using Mixture of Gaussian <br/>
### exercise3: identifying single neurons with cross-correlograms and LDA <br />
Tasks: Visual inspection of clusters and waveforms, Calculate the auto/cross-correlograms of all clusters/pairs of clusters, Implement linear discriminant analysis for cluster separation <br />
### exercise4: spike inference from calcium data <br />
Tasks: Visualization of calcium and spike recordings, calcium events happen in relationship to the spikes, so we can try simple deconvolution or implement existing algorithms for inferring spikes from calcium traces. Algorithms are evaluated by computing the correlation coefficient between true and inferred spike trains. <br />
### exercise5: visualizing and analyzing spike trains <br />
### exercise6: estimating information from spike trains <br />
### exercise7: single cell receptive field estimation <br />
### exercise8: analyzing neural populations <br />
### exercise9: RNA transcriptomics <br />
